# Sudoku-Solver
Implementing Augmented Reality based Sudoku Solver
This project uses OpenCV-Python libraries to detect sudoku puzzle in a video frame. 
The numbers in the frame are then detected and recognized using pre-trained model of deep learning on MNIST Dataset.
The sudoku with numbers and empty boxes is solved using Back-Tracking algorithm.
The solved sudoku with numbers are passed to the Video frame using warp and perspective transforms.
